# Contributing to React Block Text

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use git, all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (if a test suit exists).
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (if any).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/dherault/react-block-text/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Here's [an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent coding style

`npm run lint` for the win!

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

## Have fun

That's the most important part!
